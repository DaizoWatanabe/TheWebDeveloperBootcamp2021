/*
I've provided you with a word variable, set to "skateboard". Yout goal is to use string methods on word, so that you end up with the string "beard".
1. Use a string method to extract the "board" part of "skateboard"
2. Replace the "o" in board with an "e"
3. Save the result in a variable called facialHair

// DON'T TOUCH THIS LINE! (please)
const word = "skateboard"; //Don't change this line!

let facialHair = word.slice(5).replace("o", "e");

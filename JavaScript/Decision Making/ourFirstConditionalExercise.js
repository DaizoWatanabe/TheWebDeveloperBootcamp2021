/*
Let's get some practice with conditional statements! In order to make your code repeatable and testable, I'm asking you to write your code inside a pre-defined function (something we have not yet covered in the course).
Write your code between the two comments.
You will automatically have access to a variable called num. Please do not try to define or change num in any way. 
If num is an even number, print out "even". Don't do anything if num is an odd number.

function isEven(num){
    //WRITE YOUR CODE BETWEEN THIS LINE: ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ 
   if (num%2 === 0) {
       console.log("even");
   }
   
    //AND THIS LINE ↑↑↑↑↑
}

# Multiple Args Exercise

In some dice games like Craps, a roll of two 1's is called "Snake Eyes". It's generally not a <br>
good roll. Please write a function called ```isSnakeEyes```, which accepts two numbers as <br>
inputs, representing two dice. If the two numbers are both 1's, please print "Snake Eyes!"<br>
otherwise print "Not Snake Eyes!" <br>
``` 
  ìsSnakeEyes(1,1) //Snake Eyes!
  ìsSnakeEyes(1,5) //Not Snake Eyes!
  ìsSnakeEyes(4,5) //Not Snake Eyes!
```
